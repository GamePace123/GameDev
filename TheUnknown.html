            <p class="ColorWhite">The timeline is set 100 000 years into the future after a huge war that occurred between U.C.F and T.S.C. during a 60459 year period. The U.C.F lost the war, The interstellar corporation consisted mostly of humans and was dismantled after the war. When the war was over the T.S.C put their plan to work, they helped the people grow and flourish and gave them security in exchange for a small favor. They built large cities and gave what the citizens craved for. 5000 years after the supposed war people saw the T.S.C as gods and worshiped them for saving them.

                Nearly 1000 years later the T.S.C became worried and started to prepare for whatever it was. They called the event The Unknown. A solar system appeared out of nowhere. The System became a strategic position because of its unusual amount of concentrated resources. T.S.C Launched a recon squad to investigate the habitable planet Arion. A day later they lost contact with the squad and are about to send an elite squad of soldiers to investigate the disappearance.
