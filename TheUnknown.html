            <h2 class="ColorWhite HeaderRub HeaderClass">The Background story</h2>
            <p class="ColorWhite">The timeline is set 100 000 years into the future after a huge war that occurred between <a class="Link-Style" href="#UCf-Defenition">U.C.F</a> and <a class="Link-Style" href="#TSC-Defenition">T.S.C</a> during a 60459 year period. The <a class="Link-Style" href="#UCf-Defenition">U.C.F</a> lost the war, The interstellar corporation consisted mostly of humans and was dismantled after the war. When the war was over the <a class="Link-Style" href="#TSC-Defenition">T.S.C</a> put their plan to work, they helped the people grow and flourish and gave them security in exchange for a small favor. They built large cities and gave what the citizens craved for. 5000 years after the supposed war people saw the <a class="Link-Style" href="#TSC-Defenition">T.S.C</a> as gods and worshiped them for saving them.

                <br><br>Nearly 1000 years later the <a class="Link-Style" href="#TSC-Defenition">T.S.C</a> became worried and started to prepare for whatever it was. They called the event The Unknown. A solar system appeared out of nowhere. The System became a strategic position because of its unusual amount of concentrated resources. <a class="Link-Style" href="#TSC-Defenition">T.S.C</a> Launched a recon squad to investigate the habitable planet Arion-63C. A day later they lost contact with the squad and are about to send an elite squad of soldiers to investigate the disappearance.
